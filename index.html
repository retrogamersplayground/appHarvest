                                    Ramel Smooth Bradley is a former starting point guard for the University of Kentucky, the winningest program in college basketball. Ramel graduated with a degree from the College of Agriculture, Food and Environment then played basketball professionally in Europe and the Middle East for nine years, with stops in Croatia, France, Israel, and Turkey. On a visit home to Brooklyn, he saw firsthand how a lack of access to affordable, healthy food caused difficulties for his family and community. He returned to Kentucky to join AppHarvest and leads our agricultural entrepreneurs program at Shelby Valley High School in Eastern Kentucky's Pike County.
